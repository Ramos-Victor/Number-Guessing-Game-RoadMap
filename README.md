# Number-Guessing-Game-RoadMap

A simple and fun console-based game developed in Python, where the player must guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts based on the selected difficulty level.

# About the Project

This project was created for the website https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game and also for practice:

Conditional logic

Loops

User input handling

Random number generation

Basic game mechanics in Python

The goal of the game is to guess a number between 1 and 100.
The player chooses a difficulty level which determines the number of allowed attempts.

# How the Game Works

The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.

The player selects a difficulty level:

| Difficulty | Attempts |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Easy       | 10       |
| Medium     | 5        |
| Hard       | 3        |

The player enters guesses.

After each guess, the program gives a hint:

The secret number is greater than your guess

or less than your guess

The game ends when:

The player guesses correctly, or

The attempts are over.

# Features

• Three difficulty levels

• Dynamic hint system

• Attempt counter

• Randomized gameplay

• Simple and interactive CLI interface

# How to Run the Game

1️⃣ Requirements

Python 3.10+ (required for match-case syntax)

2️⃣ Clone or download the project
